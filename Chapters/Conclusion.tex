\begin{chapter}{Conclusion}
As seen in the result section, our model properly outputs some transliteration values. It has shown a promising \textbf{BLUE score of 49.52}. Compute resources are high and training and other data cleanups take a lot of time. So the challenges are in the hardware requirements side.

Future research opportunities include: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item training with larger corpus from OPUS Data \cite{opusData}.
    \item Optimizing it for running deployments
    \item Various optimization for cleanups and training
\end{itemize}
